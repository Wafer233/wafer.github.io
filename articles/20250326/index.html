                <h2 class="section-heading">Why I Built This Blog Website</h2>

                <p>Hey buddy, want to hear my story? It’s a long, long one. Over the past half year, I’ve been grinding
                    non-stop to land a job. I started off chasing an algorithm role, but after getting mentally crushed,
                    I pivoted to development. I took quite a few detours. Honestly, if I had stuck with algorithms,
                    maybe I’d still be chilling in the lab right now, training my neural network like nothing ever
                    changed.</p>

                <p>Back to the point — I used to think building a personal blog meant you had to deal with frontend and
                    backend. For someone who’s only been learning Go development for like 6 to 12 months, that sounded
                    like mission impossible. After finishing a half-baked mini-blog project (kind of like readnote), all
                    I could think about backend was just one word: hard.</p>
                <p>From setting up routes, to building layered structures, connecting API endpoints down to the DAO
                    layer, then linking it to a database, and that database needing to talk to the cloud... and don’t
                    even get me started on frontend-backend communication. Oh, and domain names too. Ugh. Just thinking
                    about it gave me a headache. I almost quit right there.</p>
                <p>But I kept seeing people with these github.io. I was like, “Wait, are these free or what?” I
                    never really looked into it. Then came the night of March 26th, 2025. It was past midnight, and, as
                    usual, I couldn’t sleep. So I thought, “What the heck, let’s poke around. If it’s too hard, I’ll
                    give up and go to bed.”</p>
                <p>Spoiler alert: diving into tech is just... addictive. One all-nighter later, this blog was born.
                    Sure, I started with someone else’s template, but after patching things up here and there, it
                    actually started to look like a real blog.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">The Role of AI in All This</h2>

                <p>And this — this is where AI comes in. This blog wouldn't exist without it. The template? Found it
                    through AI. The bugs? Fixed them with AI. The functions and what the heck the code even means? Yup,
                    all explained by AI. With ChatGPT’s help, this blog was built bit by bit, like raising a baby —
                    messy, stressful, but kind of cute in the end.</p>
                <p>I remember back in my sophomore and junior years, there was no ChatGPT, no DeepSeek, no fancy AI
                    tools. Learning meant watching endless bilibili or chinese mooc tutorials. As a robotics major
                    trying to self-learn
                    software engineering, it was tough. I pulled through, but wow, it was a long, painful road.</p>
                <p>These days, every time I check tech posts, it’s either “programmers are doomed” or “worst year to
                    code.” And yeah, AI did shake things up for us devs. But honestly, I see AI more as an assistant,
                    not a replacement. If I had to pick one word for it, it’d be “copilot.” That’s exactly what it is —
                    a second seat, not the driver.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">What’s Next in the Future</h2>
                <p>To be honest, I used to hate Git, avoid GitHub, and never touched Markdown. But after finally giving
                    them a shot — wow, they’re pretty convenient. Same with this blog. Writing in HTML feels kinda
                    weird, and I might switch to Markdown in the future. But since this is my first-ever blog post, I
                    figured I’d stick with good ol’ HTML and finish it proper.

                </p>
